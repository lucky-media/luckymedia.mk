Lucky Media’s mission is to enhance the efficiency of the digital marketing industry and improve the customer reach of marketing strategies. Our goal is to implement the best combination of the latest technologies for providing efficient and effective solutions that will exceed the needs of our clients. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that we can use when tackling the different requirements of our clients. Thus, by attending conferences, events, workshops and following up the latest changes in technology on a regular basis, we keep ourselves always updated. This ensures that our solutions are also updated and comply with the requirements of the industry standards. We believe that sharing is caring and that’s the cornerstone of our success. That is reflected by our teaching and training of many students for free offline in our office. This blog is a similar contribution to the society while sharing the technologies that we use and the reason behind their usage. We believe that the digital marketing industry can only further develop by sharing our knowledge and supporting each other.

We do not imply that the following technologies are suitable for every project, or neither that they will always be the best approach. But, we want to present our current approach and the technologies that we use at this moment. As technologies change, we will also update our blog and we encourage our readers to check our latest posts. Please feel free to send us feedback, suggestions or questions and we will be glad to communicate with you.
