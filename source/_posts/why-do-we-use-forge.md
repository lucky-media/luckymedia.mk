If you visit the official Forge website you can read “Server management doesn't have to be a nightmare.” They know exactly why it was important to mention that server management is a nightmare, and it doesn’t have to be. If you have experience working with servers and managing the production environment, then you know what we are talking about. It’s mostly about losing time, because it takes much longer to manage everything on the server on your own. But, you also want to make sure that the setup is exactly as needed and there are no errors. Forge is not for free and you have three different packages to choose from.

Forge offers you a simple and fast deployment of your application on a server such as DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, Amazon, etc. Forge links to your account on the cloud provider and then the management is done through Forge. The application is deployed in a few minutes. You can now focus on writing code and developing apps, instead of worrying about server management. The dashboard is very easy to understand and it has all the important features.

If you have read our Netlify post about static sites, then you understand the connection with Github. We can use the same technique here, keep our code on Github and a push to master branch activates the deployment process in Forge. Sit back and relax.

It installs Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, Redis and many other features that you need for the production environment. You will have the latest PHP version in no time. Free SSL Certificates are also provided by Forge.
