A brand new restaurant needs a brand new design. A design that is slick, elegant and effective. The website contains the food menu, social media connection, contact informaiton and a waitlist connected to YELP. The increased popularity of the restaurant has proportionally increased the traffic on the platform and vice versa. The owner is very pleased with the user feedback of the design and usability of the website.
